## The Train Time App

The app provide **up-to-date information about various trains**, their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. Users will be able to view the same train times from many different machines. 

As an administrator you can add: 
1. train name
2. destination
3. first train time (in military time)
4. frequency (in minutes)

The app was built with the **_Materialize CSS framework_** and incorporates **_Firebase_** for hosting arrival and departure data. The app retrives and manipulates the information with **_Moment.js_**. It calculates when the next train wil arrive, relative to the current time.
